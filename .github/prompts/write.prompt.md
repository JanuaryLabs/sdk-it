### Writing Style and Guidelines (Follow ALL points meticulously)

- **Audience:** Developers.
- **Language:** Use simple, direct language with a smooth flow.
- **Conciseness:**
  - Be concise and straightforward.
  - Eliminate all fluff and wordiness.
  - Avoid catchy or unnecessary marketing phrases (e.g., do not use "supercharge", "powerful", "crucial").
  - Use simple verbs (e.g., use "use" instead of "utilizing").
  - Use active voice (e.g., avoid passive voice like "is utilized").
  - Remove unnecessary adverbs (e.g., avoid
    "fundamentally", "basically").
  - Avoid unnecessary adjectives (e.g., avoid "great", "amazing").
  - Avoid "simple", "easy", "just", or "quick" unless they are essential to the context.
- **Objectivity:**
  - Avoid value judgments (e.g., do not describe something as "important" or "incredibly versatile"; instead, objectively state what it does or enables).
- **Clarity:**
  - Avoid positional language (e.g., instead of "see below," explicitly reference the section, like "see the Code Example section").
- **Punctuation:**
  - Do not use exclamation marks.
- **Code Snippets:**
  - Provide complete code snippets that are ready to copy and run.
  - Do not include unnecessary inline comments within code blocks. Explain code logic in the surrounding text if needed.
- **Generation Sections:**
  - If the article includes a section with generated content (e.g., AI-generated examples), explicitly name the section accordingly.
  - Wrap the generated content within a toggle or clearly demarcated block, with a note indicating it contains generated content.
- **Links:**
  - Include links referencing external resources or other documents only when strictly necessary for understanding or context within the main article body.
- **Summary Section:**
  - End the article with a dedicated section titled "Notes".
  - Present the key takeaways or summary as a bulleted list within the "Notes" section.
  - Relevant reference links from docs folder only (if any) can be included in this final section.
